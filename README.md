# Beatbox
The ultimate damage-dealer

## Important Information

This application started recently as a base project to learn C#, .NET and more important WPF.
It does not work yet, but I hope it indicates how well I am progressing with this (for me) new technology stack.

## Update (22.10.)

First working version released!
Yes! Thats right. After a few days of working with C# and WPF my small application is really doing great.
I managed to get some nice functionality going:
- UI design (using different panels and controls using WPF)
- control binding (using XAML and C# for events)
- animation, yes thats right (making images move on the UI)
- background worker included (calculating stuff while UI stays responsive)
But that's only the beginning, more to come.

## How to use

For now, before the first release, download the code (or clone it) and execute it in Visual Studio.
